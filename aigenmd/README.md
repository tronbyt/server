# AI-Generated Documentation

This directory contains documentation files automatically generated by the AI assistant during development sessions.

## Purpose

These markdown files serve as:
- **Implementation guides** - Detailed explanations of features and changes
- **Technical documentation** - Code examples and usage instructions
- **Decision records** - Rationale behind implementation choices
- **Reference material** - Quick lookup for how features work

## Contents

- `ADDAPP_VERSION_DISPLAY.md` - System apps version display on add app page
- `API_PINNING_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - API endpoint for app pinning functionality
- `GEMINI.md` - Gemini AI integration notes
- `PINNED_APP_NOTIFICATION.md` - Pinned app badge next to device name
- `UPLOAD_APP_DELETE_BUTTON.md` - Delete button for uploaded apps

## Note

These files are generated during development and may become outdated as the codebase evolves. They represent a snapshot of the implementation at the time they were created.

## Maintenance

Feel free to:
- Delete files that are no longer relevant
- Archive old documentation
- Update files if implementations change significantly
- Use as reference when working on related features
