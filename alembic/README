Generic single-database configuration with SQLModel support.

This directory contains Alembic migrations for the Tronbyt Server database.

## Creating a New Migration

After modifying models in `tronbyt_server/db_models/models.py`:

```bash
# Auto-generate a migration (recommended)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"

# Or create an empty migration
alembic revision -m "description of changes"
```

## Running Migrations

```bash
# Upgrade to the latest version
alembic upgrade head

# Upgrade to a specific version
alembic upgrade <revision>

# Downgrade one version
alembic downgrade -1

# See current version
alembic current

# See migration history
alembic history
```

## Migration Files

Migration files are stored in `alembic/versions/` and are automatically
applied when the application starts via `init_db()`.
